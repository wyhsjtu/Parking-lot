# Intersteller Parking Lot

## BASIC INFORMATION:
1. As Suggested in the project manual, we define the class Vec and the operator of this class. This makes our life easier in the following step;

2. We define the class figure with colored figure and group as its sub-class. Rectangle and other basic figures are defined as sub-class in the class colored figure. UFO and other objects are defined as sub-class of group;
3. By adjusting two Vec, postion and achor, we are able to define the method of the group;
4. Finally, with the use of variable flag, and rand(); we are able to accomplish the task;
5. We use timefunc to make it refresh 25 times per second;

## WAYS TO IMPROVE
  
1. We should try to use STL Vector to make it run better;

2. We could adjust the color to make it more beautiful;

3. Due to the time limit, we forget to add the gate of the parking lot, we will add it in the next version;

## OTHER THINGSï¼š
1.Don't be evil.

2.Be kind.
